全文書き起こしをメモ：

> This is a proud moment for all of us at Nvidia.
> We've worked with Nintendo for more than a decade,
> drawn together by a shared belief
> that technology should serve creativity and
> that joy is worth engineering for.
>
> I still remember the day Iwata-san shared his dream with us.
> He wanted to create something no one had seen before.
> A console powerful enough for big cinematic games
> but small enough to take anywhere.
> It sounded impossible.
> But that vision became the original Nintendo Switch.
> We lost Iwata-san before the launch,
> but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day.
>
> Together we poured everything into that system.
> The Nintendo Switch took over 500 engineer years at NVIDIA.
> We rethought the entire stack, chip architecture, OS, APIs, game engines, so the magic could travel with you.
> The results speak for themselves.
> Over 150 million consoles sold, a global platform that brought families together, empowered indie creators, and redefined what a console could be.
>
> And now, a bold new chapter begins.
> The mission, build a new console that takes the original vision further.
> To make it so, we had to reinvent everything.
> The chip inside Nintendo Switch 2 is unlike anything we've built before.
> It brings together three breakthroughs.
> The most advanced graphics ever in a mobile device,
> full hardware ray tracing, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) for brighter highlights and deeper shadows,
> and an architecture that supports backward compatibility,
> dedicated AI processors to sharpen, animate, and enhance gameplay in real time,
> and it's ultra low power.
> We optimized the semiconductor process technology for high performance in a handheld device,
> so it can go wherever you go.
>
> This chip is a technical marvel.
> It delivers performance, intelligence, and beauty in the palm of your hand.
> Switch 2 is more than a new console.
> It's a new chapter worthy of Iwata-san's vision.
> To our friends at Nintendo, congratulations.
> We're honored to be on this journey with you.
> And to everyone who loves games, let the fun begin.

### 木曜日

曇りときどき雨、蒸し暑い日。

ウィンブルドン。Highlight で見てるだけだと、ジョコビッチに衰えを感じてたが、
ちゃんと勝ち上がってた：

今年37歳。フェデラーの引退は40歳を超えてた気がする。
お調子者のヤンチャな若者というイメージはとうになくなり、
タフで粘り強く静かな老兵という印象。
この印象は 2021 年の全仏オープンの[インタビュー](https://africa.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/31625383/novak-djokovic-rallies-two-sets-win-french-open-19th-grand-slam-title)から続いてる：

> "There's always two voices inside: There is one telling you that you can't do it, that it's done, it's finished. That voice was pretty strong after that second set,'' Djokovic said. "So I felt that that was a time for me to actually vocalize the other voice and try to suppress the first one that was saying I can't make it. I told myself I can do it. Encouraged myself. I strongly started to repeat that inside of my mind, tried to live it with my entire being.''

晩御飯、鶏胸肉とニラの炒め物。
